// Comparison Operators are used to compare values of variables.

let n:number = 7;

console.log(n == 5); // Checks that value of n is equal to 5.
// Outputs false because the value of n is not equal to 5, it's 7.

console.log(n === 5); 
// Outputs false because even though the type and value are same for both operands but they are different data types..

console.log(n != 5);
//Output is true because n is not equal to 5

console.log(n > 5);
//Output is true because n is greater than 5

console.log(n < 5);
//Output is false because n is greater than 5

console.log(n >= 5);
//Output is true because n is greater or equal to 5

console.log(n <= 5);
//Output is false because n is greater than 5
